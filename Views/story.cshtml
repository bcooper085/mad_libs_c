    <h1>One great adventure</h1>
    <p>One day, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() were walking down the street,
    when suddenly a tiny @Model.GetAnimal() appeared. "@Model.GetExclamation()!"
    @Model.GetPerson2() whispered. The two of them @Model.GetVerb() as awkwardly as possible,
    and when they were drunk, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() gave each other a terrible @Model.GetNoun().</p>
